# CSE-VITYARTHI-PROJECT
EasyBook is a lightweight, single-file movie ticket booking application that runs in your terminal/command prompt. It lets users register, log in, browse available movie shows, book tickets, view their bookings, and cancel them — just like a mini version of BookMyShow or Ticketnew, but built for learning and fun.
