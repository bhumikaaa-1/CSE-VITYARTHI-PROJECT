Project Statement – EasyBook Movie Ticket Booking System

#Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, moviegoers often face inconvenience while booking tickets through traditional methods or overcrowded online platforms. There is a need for a simple, fast, and user-friendly system that allows users to view available movie shows, book tickets instantly, check their bookings, and cancel them if required — all from a single interface without complexity or dependency on third-party services.

The current console-based solution addresses this need by providing a lightweight, menu-driven movie ticket booking system that simulates real-world functionality using basic data structures and user authentication.

#Scope of the Project
The project is a console-based Movie Ticket Booking System developed using Python. It demonstrates core programming concepts while providing essential ticketing functionality. The scope includes:

- User registration and login authentication
- Viewing real-time availability of movie shows
- Booking one or more tickets with automatic seat deduction
- Viewing and cancelling personal bookings with seat restoration
- In-memory data persistence during runtime
- Clean and interactive text-based user interface

Out of scope (intentionally excluded for simplicity):
- Persistent storage (database/file)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Online payment integration
- Admin module
- Seat selection matrix
- Multi-theater support

# Target Users
1. Students learning Python programming (primary audience)
2. Beginners exploring console application development
3. Individuals wanting a simple personal movie booking simulator
4. Academic project submitters (college/school students)
5. Anyone interested in understanding the logic behind ticket booking systems
